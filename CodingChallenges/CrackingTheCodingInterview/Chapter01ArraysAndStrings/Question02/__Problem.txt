1.2 Given two strings write a method to decidde if one is a permutation of the other.


#1		Describe what it means for two string be a permutation of each other. Now, look at that definition you provided. Can you check the string agains that definition?
#84		There's one solution that is O(N log N) time. Another solution uses some space, but is O(n) time.
#122	Could a hash table be useful?
#131	Two strings that are permutation should have the same characteres, but in different orders. Can you make the orders the same?
