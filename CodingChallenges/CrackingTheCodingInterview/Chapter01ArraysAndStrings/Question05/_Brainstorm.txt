Solution 1:
If the two strings have different size by one, then it's possible is a insert or delete
If the second has more characters, we start to check both indexes at the same rate.
But if we find anything different, we start to check the bigger string at +1 index
If the second string is smaller, we apply the same logic, but we don't add the index one
So by the end, if we arrive at the end of the string with no more differences, they are one edit away

For modificiation, we can check if they are the same size, if they are we allow one difference
at the same index. More than one returns false


bigger = text2.Length > 0 ? text2 : text1;
smaller = text2.Length <= 0 ? text2 : text1;
if(bigger - smaller > 1)
{
	return false;
}
else if(text.Length == text2.Length)
{
	replaced = true;
}

int differences = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < bigger.Length; i++)
{
	bool isEqual = bigger[i+differences] == smaller[i];
	if(!isEqual && differences == 0)
	{
		if(!replaced)
		{
			differences++;
		}
	}
	else if(!isEqual)
	{
		return false;
	}
}

return true;
